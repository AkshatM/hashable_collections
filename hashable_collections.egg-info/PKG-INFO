Description: About
        =====
        
        This library enables dictionaries and lists to be used as keys inside a
        dictionary. In other words, it makes them hashable.
        
        While mutable objects (lists, dictionaries) should not be made hashable
        in general, the programmer is trusted not to abuse this power (you *do*
        test your code before shipping into production, don't you?). An
        extension option to explicitly make the resulting hashable object
        immutable is provided below for convenience.
        
        There are certain use cases - e.g. when trying to pass seemingly
        identical keys to `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io>`__ as different
        nodes, or when you want to query an object's properties in place while
        making a mapping instead of calling a complicated identification
        function - where these may be useful and reduce boilerplate code.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            >>> from hashable_collections.hashable_collections import hashable_dict
            >>> hashed_dict = hashable_dict({'name':'foo'})
            >>> from hashable_collections.hashable_collections import hashable_list
            >>> hashed_list = hashable_list(['bar',1])
            >>> output = {hashed_dict:0,hashed_list:1}
            >>> output
            {{'name':'foo'}: 0, ['bar', 1]: 1}
        
        These hashable objects still retain mutability - in other words, it is
        still possible to assign ``hashed_dict['squiggle'] = 'squiggle'`` and
        have it execute without an issue. The hash will change correspondingly,
        effectively making it a different object from before.
        
        Alternatively, one can subclass the objects defined here and override
        the ``__setitem__`` method to make sure the resulting hashable
        dictionary/list is immutable:
        
        ::
        
            class immutable_hashable_dict(hashable_dict):
        
                def __setitem__(self,key,value):
                    raise ValueError('Immutable hashable dicts do not let you change values inside your dictionary.')
        
            class immutable_hashable_list(hashable_list):
        
                def __setitem__(self,key,value):
                    raise ValueError('Immutable hashable lists do not let you change valus inside your list.')
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        The following is a list of known issues that may crop up with this
        technology.
        
        -  Creating a copy: If ``s`` is a ``hashable_dict``, and one does
           ``m = s`` and then changes ``m[0]``, the corresponding value of
           ``s[0]`` is changed as well. **Never** assign an existing
           hashable\_dict or hashable\_list to another object unless you are
           sure the second object is not going to change.
        
        Installation
